# Stock Market Prediction and Forecasting Using Stacked LSTM

This repository contains the code for predicting stock market prices and forecasting using Stacked LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks. The model is built using Keras and TensorFlow >2.0.

## Overview

Stock market prediction is a challenging task due to its volatile nature. This project aims to predict stock prices and perform forecasting using historical data.

## Features

- Data collection from Tiingo API.
- Preprocessing of data including scaling using MinMaxScaler.
- Building and training Stacked LSTM model.
- Evaluation of model performance using RMSE (Root Mean Square Error).
- Visualization of predictions and forecasting.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/stock-market-prediction.git
```

2. Install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook stockMarketprediction.ipynb
```

4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute the code.

## Usage

- Open the Jupyter Notebook `stockMarketprediction.ipynb`.
- Follow the step-by-step instructions provided in the notebook to execute each cell.
- Modify the code as per your requirements and experiment with different parameters.
- Analyze the model performance and visualize the predictions.
